Details for teaching team

First time with Laravel set up, run into a few issues but was able to trouble shoot- took a while to get comfortable
especially with the blade syntax but got comfortable half way through.  Not too happy with the way my Faker turned out but will continue to work on perfecting my skills with working with creating forms.
Overall it was a bit challenging but got it done!

My Random User Generator worked on local host but not on the livesite.  All commits were timely with the exception of the last one; I was having some problems with this working on the live site.  My User generating is working on the local host but not on the live site.
